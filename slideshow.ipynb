After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest database of 105 million places and is used by over 125,000 developers.

On the other hand, *cluster 1* has very low number to no shopping mall in the neighbourhoods. \n\nThis represents a great opportunity and high potential areas to open new shopping malls as there is very little to no competition from existing malls"

To answer the business question that was raised in the introduction section, the answer proposed by this project is: The neighbourhoods in cluster 1 are the most preferred locations to open a new shopping mall. The findings of this project will help the relevant stakeholders to capitalize on the opportunities on high potential locations while avoiding overcrowded areas in their decisions to open a new shopping mall."
